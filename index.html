                Hi, I'm <b>Lemuria</b>. My name is already taken on a lot of other
                websites; if that happens I usually go by <b>a_random_lemurian</b>
                instead. I'm from the Philippines, with an interest in linguistics,
                fictional maps, and so much more.
            </p>

        <h2>Socials and links</h2>
        <p>
            Of course I have socials, because then how else would I exist on
            the net?
        </p>

        <h3>OpenGeofiction</h3>
        <p>
            <b>OpenGeofiction</b> is a fictional mapping website that I was most
            active in during 2023. I still exist on the website.

        <h2>Linguistics</h2>
        <p>
            I have a major <b>linguistics</b> obsession. I have no degrees (yet).
        </p>
        <p>
            I also made a conlang called <a href="https://github.com/thiguka">Thiguka</a>.
            Most documentation of it is on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/conlangs">Conlangs 
            Discord Network</a>, but hopefully I'll be able to release more
            Thiguka materials onto GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://conlangs.lemuria.ph">There is a conlangs page.</a>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
            Lemuria is the name of a lost continent in the Indian Ocean. I
            adopted the name from when I had an interest in it, and it has
            since stuck.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Other entities named "Lemuria"</h3>
        <p>
            Any and all organizations that sell "Lemurian seed crystals" are
            scammers who engage in gross misuse of my name to spread their
            spiritual "holistic" nonsense. Stop it. <s>No, I will not take
                your money as "licensing fees", because I do not wish to
                profit off gullible spiritual people.</s></p>
        <p>
            I am also <b>not affiliated</b> with a group of two restaurants
            named "Lemuria" in BGC and Quezon City. They have been using the
            name longer than me, but given that both entities have different
            interests (computers and food service respectively), and that
            nobody has reached out to me with an inquiry clearly meant for
            the restaurant, I should be fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Lemuria wordmark, which appears below, is my logo, and should
            hopefully distinguish me from all the other <s>impersonators</s>
            entities.
